# PopOS Home Server - AI/LLM Stack

# TODO
- Need to add langfuse, worker and web and get those configured
- Need to ensure the open webui, and langfuse are able to use minio if need be.
- Need to add mastra as an agentic framework / build a quick sample agent or workflow to get that going
- Need to test it all out on the actual server to make sure this will be alright. might wind up having to scale up a bit.
